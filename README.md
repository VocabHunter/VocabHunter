# Prerequisites

You will need Java 11 (or above) to build and run VocabHunter.  The version provided by [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is an excellent choice for this.  Everything else, including Gradle, will be downloaded by the build process.

# How To Run VocabHunter

Go to the [download](https://vocabhunter.github.io/download/) page of the website to get the latest release of VocabHunter.  Alternatively, you can run the development version from the command line as follows:
~~~
$ ./gradlew :gui:run
~~~

# How to Use VocabHunter

Do you want to use VocabHunter to help you to learn a foreign language?  You'll find everything you need to know to get you started in the guide [How to Use VocabHunter](https://vocabhunter.github.io/help/).

# How To Build VocabHunter

You can build the entire system with the following command:
~~~
$ ./gradlew clean build
~~~

# How To Run The GUI Test

By default the GUI test runs as part of the standard Gradle build, in headless mode.  If you'd like to run the GUI test in a non-headless mode so that you can see what is happening, use the following command:
~~~
$ ./gradlew :gui:test --tests io.github.vocabhunter.gui.main.GuiTest --rerun-tasks -PnoHeadless
~~~

# How to Build The Installable Bundle

You can also find full, step-by-step instructions for creating the VocabHunter installable bundle using JDK 16 in [PACKAGING.md](package/PACKAGING.md).

Prior to the release of JDK 16, the VocabHunter installable bundle used to be created using JDK 11.  You can find more information about this in the article [Using the Java Packager with JDK 11].
